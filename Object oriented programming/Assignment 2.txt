Make a game that will ask people to guess a word

1. Make a list of words like 100 or so   (help: copy text from a blog or news article and keep all words longer than 3 or 5 characters to avoid stopwords)
2. Ask user to play (y / n) option
3. If user wants to play, guess a word (generate a random integer number from zero to the length-1 of the array... pick the word as random number index)
4. Provide dashes (_) equal to the length of the word.
5. Allow user to inter characters, if it matches, print the words again but providing dashes for characters not guessed yet and and guessed characters for others.
6. Keep a count of mistakes, after specific mistakes say (5) quit the game printing "You Lose" otherwise "You Win"
7. Ask the user if he/she wants to play again
