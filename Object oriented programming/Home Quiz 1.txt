Write a program using overloaded functions such that;

Task 1:
int difference(int a, int b){
	//return the difference between two number (difference must be positive)
}
int difference(string a, string b){
	//return the difference of characters between the strings
}


Task 2:
Write a recursive function to convert a binary number input into decimal number
int convert(int a){
	//a will be in binary (although you may keep its type as int)
	//recursively convert it to decimal and return the decimal number
}
